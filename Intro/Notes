### Main responsibilities:
 -> ask questionsto begin the discovery process;
 -> acquire data;
 -> process and clean the data;
 -> integrate and store the data;
 -> data investigation/exploratory data analysis (EDA);
 -> pick one or more models and algorithms;
 -> apply data science techniques: machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence;
 -> measure and improve results;
 -> present final result to stakeholders;
 -> make adjustments based on feedback;
 -> repeat the process to solve a new problem.
 

### Data Science Project Lifecycle:
 -> Project planning: problem to be solved or data to be explored;
 -> Data collection: it is recommended to collect data via web scraper but there are Kaggle or Google datasets available;
 -> Data cleaning: to make the data usable for models;
 -> EDA: highlight trends with visuals to make them stand out;
 -> Model building: try different models to see which one works bestfor the specific case;
 -> Models deployment (optional): to make the model useful to someone as an API endpoint.
 
 
### Main problems to solve:
 -> Regression
 -> Classification
 -> Clustering
 
 
 ### Data Science five-stage life-cycle:
  -> Capture: data acquisition, data entry, signal reception, data extraction;
  -> Maintain: data warehousing, data cleansing, data staging, data processing, data architecture;
  -> Process: data minig, clustering/classification, data modeling, data summarization;
  -> Communicate: data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, decision making;
  -> analyze: exploratory/confirmatory, predictive analysis, regression, text mining, qualitative analysis.
